# Genetic Algorithm Implementation for Single-Objective Problems

Welcome to this **Genetic Algorithm Implementation** repository! This project provides an in-depth implementation of genetic algorithms to solve two single-objective optimization problems. The repository includes two versions of the solution:
1. **From Scratch** – a complete implementation of the genetic algorithm without using external libraries.
2. **Using a Genetic Algorithm Library** – leveraging an established GA library for comparison and optimization.
